BigEndian TASK

File Transfer with Packet Order and Checksum Verification
Summary
This project implements a reliable file transfer system using Python sockets, focusing on maintaining packet order and data integrity through checksum verification. It ensures that file transfers are robust and error-free by employing acknowledgment (ACK) and negative acknowledgment (NACK) techniques.

Key Features
Reliable File Transfer:
Ensures accurate file transmission from client to server.

Packet Ordering:
Maintains the correct order of packets using sequence numbers to prevent data loss or duplication.

Checksum Verification:

A unique checksum (SHA-256 hash) is generated for each packet.
The server verifies each packet's integrity by matching the received checksum with the calculated checksum.
Any checksum mismatch triggers a packet retransmission.
Error Handling:

If a packet's checksum doesn't match, the server sends a NACK (negative acknowledgment) to the client.
Correct packets receive an ACK (positive acknowledgment) for successful transfer.
How It Works
Server Setup:

The server listens for incoming connections.
It validates packets and ensures proper file assembly.
Client Transmission:

The client reads the file in chunks, calculates checksums, and sends packets with their sequence numbers.
Verification and Acknowledgment:

The server verifies each packet's checksum.
Acknowledges successful packets (ACK) or requests retransmissions (NACK).
Checksum Handling:

Different files produce varying checksums for data integrity verification.
This ensures that even minor file changes are detectable.`
